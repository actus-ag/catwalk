Compared with prior Qwen3 instruct variants, it focuses on higher throughput and stability on ultra-long inputs and multi-turn dialogues, making it well-suited for RAG, tool use, and agentic workflows that require consistent final answers rather than visible chain-of-thought.\n\nThe model employs scaling-efficient training and decoding to improve parameter efficiency and inference speed, and has been validated on a broad set of public benchmarks where it reaches or approaches larger Qwen3 systems in several categories while outperforming earlier mid-sized baselines. It is best used as a general assistant, code helper, and long-context task solver in production settings where deterministic, instruction-following outputs are preferred.",

Searches are priced at $5/1000 searches. A request that does 30 searches will cost $0.15 in this step.\n- Reasoning is a distinct step in Deep Research since it does extensive automated reasoning through all the material it gathers during its research phase. Reasoning tokens here are a bit different than the CoTs in the answer - these are tokens that we use to reason through the research material prior to generating the outputs via the CoTs.

What makes olmOCR particularly valuable for developers is its ability to handle challenging PDFs that traditional OCR tools struggle with—including complex layouts, poor-quality scans, handwritten text, and documents with mixed content types. Built on a fine-tuned 7B vision-language model, olmOCR provides enterprise-grade PDF processing at a fraction of the cost of proprietary solutions.",
